# Simple-ETL-Pipeline-Tutorial
Guide users through building an ETL pipeline that extracts data from a CSV file, transforms it to calculate insights, and loads the cleaned data into a database or a new CSV file.

# Simple ETL Pipeline Tutorial  

## Overview  
This project demonstrates how to create a simple ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Python. The example processes fictional sales data, calculates insights, and stores the cleaned data for further use.

---

## Pipeline Workflow  
1. **Extract**: Load raw data from a CSV file.  
2. **Transform**: Clean and enrich the data by adding new columns and applying filters.  
3. **Load**: Save the processed data to a new CSV file or a SQLite database.

---

## Prerequisites  
- Python 3.7+
- Install dependencies using:  
  ```bash
  pip install pandas matplotlib sqlite3
  ```

---

## Steps to Run the Pipeline  
1. Clone the repository.  
2. Place your source data in the `data/` folder.  
3. Run the ETL script:  
   ```bash
   python scripts/etl_pipeline.py
   ```
4. Check the output folder for transformed data.

## Example Visualizations

## Next Steps  
- Expand the pipeline to handle multiple files.  
- Integrate with cloud services like AWS S3 for storage.  
- Automate using Apache Airflow or Prefect.

### **Next Steps**  
Would you like me to prepare the code files or add more advanced features, like scheduling with **Apache Airflow** or cloud integration?
